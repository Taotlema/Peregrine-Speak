## Quick Start

### Linux/macOS
1. Extract the package
2. Open terminal in the extracted folder
3. Run: `./run_peregrine_speak.sh`

### Windows
1. Extract the package
2. Double-click `run_peregrine_speak.bat`
3. Or double-click `PeregrineSpeak.exe` directly

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows 10+
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for models and cache
- **Audio**: Working audio output device
- **Network**: Internet connection for first-time voice model download

## First Run

On first launch, Peregrine Speak will:
1. Download AI voice models (~500MB)
2. Initialize the speech engine
3. Display the welcome screen

This may take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet connection.

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Output
- Check system volume and audio device
- Try different audio output device in system settings
- Restart the application

### Slow Performance
- Close other applications to free up memory
- On first run, wait for model download to complete
- Use shorter text segments for faster processing

### Application Won't Start
- Check that you have audio drivers installed
- Try running from terminal to see error messages:
  - Linux/macOS: `./PeregrineSpeak`
  - Windows: Open Command Prompt and run `PeregrineSpeak.exe`

## Support

For additional help:
- Check README.md for detailed documentation
- Visit our GitHub repository for issues and updates
- Review system requirements above
